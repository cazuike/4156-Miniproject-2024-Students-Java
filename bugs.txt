Bugs found:

Course.java
	- enrollStudent()

		- can be incremented even when it is impossible to enroll a student
	- dropStudent()
		- always returns false

	- isCourseFull()
		- returns the opposite of what it should
	- getInstructorName

	- getCourseLocation
		- returns instructor name
	- enrolledStudenCount should be 0
Department.java
	- toString() is "result.toString()" instead of result.toString()
	- number of majors could be negative, from dropPersonFromMajor()
	- getNumberOfMajors() returns a negative value
	- departmentChair was "this.departmentChair", should not have "". 
RouteController.java
	-retrieveDepartment has swapped httpStatus codes
		- not_found for ok, and vice versa
	-retrieveCourse - a correct response would return forbidden
	-getMajorCtFromDept returns a negative value
	-getMajorCtFromDept uses wrong status code for not found, uses FORBIDDEN
	-findCourseTime would return "some time" instead of the actual course time"
	-handleException would return with OK status instead of internal error
