If interested in running, clone the repo and run the following

``` mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.arguments="setup"```

After this, run  mvn clean test  and  mvn jacoco:report to verify the code coverage. 

I have my bugs listed in bugs.txt + the required documents citations.txt and honesty.txt on the top level as well.
