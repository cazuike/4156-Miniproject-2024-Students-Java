I've used stackOverflow and the Spring/junit documentation extensively to help me complete this miniproject assignment. I've linked the resources I've used below.

I mainly used stackoverflow to understand how do I create tests, particularly for route controller. I also referenced the Spring documentation extensively. I ran into numerous issues when trying to make routecontroller tests and stackoverflow was excellent at unblocking me. I learned about mockmvc, @autowired for automatic dependency injection from both stackoverflow and the Spring Documentation, and about how to properly construct a test for checking that api endpoint works. More or less my main resources were the Spring Documentation and StackOverflow.
